The '''2016 UEFA Champions League Final''' was the final match of the [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League]], the 61st season of Europe's premier club [[association football|football]] tournament organised by [[UEFA]], and the 24th season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the [[UEFA Champions League]]. It was played at the [[San Siro]] stadium in [[Milan]], Italy, on 28 May 2016,<ref name="2016 host">{{cite news |title=Milan to host 2016 UEFA Champions League final |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2149699.html |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=18 September 2014 |accessdate=19 September 2014 }}</ref> between Spanish teams [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[Atlético Madrid]], in a repeat of the [[2014 UEFA Champions League Final|2014 final]]. It was the second time in the tournament's history that both finalists were from the same city. Real Madrid won 5–3 on a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw at the end of extra time, securing a record-extending 11th title in the competition.

Real Madrid earned the right to play against the winners of the [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League]], [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]], in the [[2016 UEFA Super Cup]]. They also qualified to enter the semi-finals of the [[2016 FIFA Club World Cup]] as the UEFA representative.

==Venue==
[[File:Scudo2009.jpg|thumb|The San Siro in Milan was selected to host the final in September 2014.]]
The [[San Siro]], officially known as Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, was announced as the venue of the final at the UEFA Executive Committee meeting in [[Nyon]], Switzerland, on 18 September 2014,<ref name="2016 host"/> the fourth European Cup/Champions League final hosted at the stadium following those in [[1965 European Cup Final|1965]], [[1970 European Cup Final|1970]] and [[2001 UEFA Champions League Final|2001]].

The San Siro was built in 1925, opened in 1926 as the home of [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], and was sold to the city in 1935. [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] became tenants in 1947, and the stadium has been shared by the two clubs ever since, with Inter winning the first European Cup final played at the stadium in 1965. The stadium was used as a venue in the [[1934 FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 1980]], and the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]. Its current capacity is 80,018, but is reduced to just under 80,000 seats for UEFA competitions.<ref name="2016 host"/>

The 2016 final marked the first time a final has been held at the San Siro when neither of its tenants were able to win the competition, as Milan and Internazionale both failed to qualify for any European competitions after their performance in the [[2014–15 Serie A]].

==Background==

Real Madrid reached a record 14th final after a 1–0 aggregate win against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], with a chance to win a [[European Cup and UEFA Champions League records and statistics|record 11th title]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36126021|title=Real Madrid 1–0 Manchester City (agg 1–0)|date=4 May 2016|work=BBC Sport}}</ref> Previously, they won finals in [[1956 European Cup Final|1956]], [[1957 European Cup Final|1957]], [[1958 European Cup Final|1958]], [[1959 European Cup Final|1959]], [[1960 European Cup Final|1960]], [[1966 European Cup Final|1966]], [[1998 UEFA Champions League Final|1998]], [[2000 UEFA Champions League Final|2000]], [[2002 UEFA Champions League Final|2002]], and 2014, and lost in [[1962 European Cup Final|1962]], [[1964 European Cup Final|1964]] and [[1981 European Cup Final|1981]]. This was also their 18th final in all UEFA club competitions, having also played in two [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] finals (losing in [[1971 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1971]] and [[1983 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1983]]) and two [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] finals (winning in [[1985 UEFA Cup Final|1985]] and [[1986 UEFA Cup Final|1986]]).

[[Atlético Madrid]] reached their third European Cup final after defeating [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] on away goals (2–2 on aggregate).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36126014|title=Bayern Munich 2–1 Atletico Madrid (agg 2–2)|date=3 May 2016|work=BBC Sport}}</ref> Their previous two European Cup finals in [[1974 European Cup Final|1974]] and 2014 both ended in defeats, to Bayern Munich and Real Madrid respectively.

Apart from the 2014 final, won by [[Real Madrid]] 4–1 after extra time, the only previous Madrid Derby matches in European competitions were in the [[1958–59 European Cup]] semi-finals, where Real Madrid won 2–1 in a replay, after a 2–2 aggregate draw, and in the [[2014–15 UEFA Champions League]] quarter-finals, where Real Madrid won 1–0 on aggregate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2360334.html|title=Real Madrid v Atlético in European competition|publisher=UEFA.com|date=4 May 2016}}</ref>

===Summary===
Real Madrid dominated possession in the early stages of the match. Six minutes into the game [[Gareth Bale]] delivered a [[Direct free kick|free-kick]] into Atlético Madrid's penalty box, which found [[Casemiro]]. His goalbound shot was cleared off the line by goalkeeper [[Jan Oblak]]. Five minutes later, [[Dani Carvajal]] received the first yellow card of the match after a late tackle on [[Antoine Griezmann]]. In the 15th minute, [[Toni Kroos]] sent a free-kick into Atlético's penalty box, which was flicked on by Bale. In the subsequent scramble, [[Sergio Ramos]] touched the ball past Oblak to score for Real.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Grez|title=Champions League final 2016: Live|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/28/football/champions-league-final-2016-live-blog/|accessdate=28 May 2016|work=[[CNN]]|date=28 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Real Madrid beat Atletico on penalties to win Champions League|url=http://www.espnfcasia.com/uefa-champions-league/match/447229/real-madrid-atletico-madrid/report|website=ESPNFC.com|accessdate=28 May 2016}}</ref> The goal stood despite video evidence subsequently showing Ramos was in an [[offside (association football)|offside]] position, meaning the goal should have been disallowed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Was Sergio Ramos offside when scoring Real Madrid’s opening Champions League final goal?|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/05/28/was-sergio-ramos-offside-when-scoring-real-madrids-opening-champions-league-final-goal-5911032/|website=Metro.co.uk|accessdate=31 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Real Madrid win Champions League on penalties after offside goal|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/sport/real-madrid-win-champions-league-on-penalties-after-offside-goal-737548.html|website=irishexaminer.com|accessdate=31 May 2016}}</ref>

In the 46th minute, [[Fernando Torres]] won a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] for Atlético after a foul from behind from [[Pepe (footballer, born 1983)|Pepe]]. Real Madrid goalkeeper [[Keylor Navas]] was shown a yellow card for delaying the kick. Griezmann took the penalty but his shot missed the goal, with the ball ricocheting off the crossbar. Substitute [[Yannick Ferreira Carrasco|Yannick Carrasco]] latched onto a cross by [[Juanfran (footballer, born 1985)|Juanfran]] from the right to equalise from close range for Atlético in the 79th minute.

The match was the eleventh European Cup/Champions League final to be decided by penalty shoot-out. With their win, Real Madrid secured a record-extending eleventh European Cup/Champions League title. This was Real Madrid's 14th appearance in a European Cup/Champions League final. The club has not lost a final since 1981. On the other hand, Atlético Madrid became the only team to lose in their first three final appearances. Juventus and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] had lost during their first two appearances in the final, but won on their third attempts in 1985 and 1992 respectively. Atlético's three losses in European Cup finals ranks them level with Barcelona, and behind only Juventus (six losses), Bayern Munich and [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] (five losses each).

Ramos, who scored the opening goal of the match, became the fifth player to score in two Champions League finals. He had not scored in the competition since scoring the equaliser against Atlético Madrid in the 2014 final. Carrasco's second-half equaliser made him the first Belgian to score in a Champions League final.<ref>{{cite web|title=UEFA Champions League 2016 - Real Madrid-Atlético Report – UEFA.com|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2016/matches/round=2000638/match=2015789/postmatch/report/index.html#spot+real+madrid+defeat+atletico+final+again|website=Uefa.com|accessdate=29 May 2016|date=28 May 2016}}</ref> Real Madrid coach Zidane became the first French coach to win the Champions League and the seventh person to win the Champions League as a player and as a coach. Muñoz, the first person to achieve the feat, had also done so by winning the title with Real Madrid as a player (in 1956 and 1957) and as a coach (in 1960 and 1966).<ref name = "seventhman"/><ref>{{cite web|title=UEFA Champions League - News – UEFA.com|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2249276.html|website=UEFA.com|accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref>

During the match, fans at an Iraqi Real Madrid fan club were attacked for the second time, bringing the [[Real Madrid fan club massacre|combined death toll]] to at least 29. In the aftermath of the attack, club president [[Florentino Pérez]] dedicated Real Madrid's victory to the fans that were killed and other Iraqi fans of the club, including others who have been killed by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]. Players had previously worn black armbands and observed moment of silence after the first attack.<ref>[http://vestnikkavkaza.net/news/Real-Madrid-s-Florentino-Perez-dedicates-Champions-League-victory-to-Iraqi-fans-killed-by-Daesh.html Real Madrid's Florentino Perez dedicates Champions League victory to Iraqi fans killed by Daesh]</ref>

===Reactions===
Zidane expressed his pride at being Real Madrid coach and winning the Champions League with the club as a player, as assistant coach and now as head coach. On the result, he said, "Both teams got to the very end – the penalties went our way but could easily have gone the other. Congratulations to Atlético and [Diego] Simeone. He's a great coach, but of course I'm happy with this victory." Simeone congratulated Real Madrid on their victory, saying, "[T]hey were better than us again, this time in the penalty shootout."<ref>{{cite web|title=UEFA Champions League 2016 - Real Madrid-Atlético Quotes – UEFA.com|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2016/matches/round=2000638/match=2015789/postmatch/quotes/index.html#zidane+proud+after+real+madrid+penalties|website=Uefa.com|accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref> When asked if he would continue as the coach of Atlético Madrid, Simeone replied, "My plan is to think.

Ronaldo told the media after the match that he had requested to take the fifth penalty because he "had a vision" that he would score the winning goal. Ronaldo added, "The penalties are always a lottery, you never know what will happen but our team showed more experience and we showed it by scoring all the penalties." Bale said that he was "cramping up", but described the win as an "amazing feeling". He also stated he felt nervous after his penalty, but not while taking it. On defeating their derby rivals, Bale added, "That's the most important thing [beating their rivals]. Obviously they gave us a great game and we're obviously feeling a little bit sorry for them but a final is a final and you have to win."<ref>{{cite web|title=Cristiano Ronaldo: 'I had a vision' I'd score decisive penalty for Real Madrid|url=http://www.espnfcasia.com/uefa-champions-league/story/2882202/cristiano-ronaldo-says-i-had-a-vision-i-would-score-decisive-penalty-for-real-madrid|website=ESPNFC.com|accessdate=28 May 2016}}</ref> [[Luka Modrić]] told the media he was happy and proud of the win, and that the team had shown character until the end. He added, "We deserved to win. I feel sorry for Atlético but I feel glad for ourselves that we won the game. This is Real Madrid's competition. The ''undecima'' ["eleventh"]. This trophy belongs to Real Madrid, it's why it's the best club in the world."<ref>{{cite web|title=Luka Modric admits he "feels sorry" for Atletico Madrid after defeat|url=http://www.sport-english.com/en/news/liga-bbva/luka-modric-admits-feels-sorry-for-atletico-madrid-after-defeat-5165972|website=Mirror.co.uk|accessdate=29 May 2016|date=28 May 2016}}</ref>
