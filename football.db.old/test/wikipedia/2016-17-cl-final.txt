The '''2017 UEFA Champions League Final''' was the final match of the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League]], the 62nd season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by [[UEFA]], and the 25th season since it was renamed from the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup]] to the [[UEFA Champions League]]. It was played at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]], Wales on 3 June 2017,<ref name="host">{{cite news |title=Cardiff to host 2017 Champions League final |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2262032.html |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=30 June 2015 |accessdate=13 May 2017 }}</ref> between [[Italian Football Federation|Italian]] side [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and [[Royal Spanish Football Federation|Spanish]] side and title holders [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], in a repeat of the [[1998 UEFA Champions League Final|1998 final]].

The match was a repeat of the [[1998 UEFA Champions League Final|1998 final]], making it the eighth repeated final pairing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2360402.html|title=Second time round: European Cup final rematches|publisher=UEFA.com|date=16 May 2017}}</ref> Real Madrid won the 1998 final 1–0.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2465618.html|title=Juventus and Real Madrid's previous final appearances|website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=10 May 2017}}</ref> The 2017 final was the first time since the two teams met in 1998 that both finalists had won either their domestic league or the Champions League the previous season.

[[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] reached their ninth final after a 4–1 aggregate win against [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] to maintain their undefeated record in this season's competition. Juventus also entered the final with the best defensive record in the 2016–17 Champions League, having conceded only thrice.<ref>{{cite web |title=2017 UEFA Champions League Final Press Kit |url=http://www.uefa.com/printoutfiles/competitions/uefachampionsleague/2017/e/e_2019641_pk.pdf |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=May 2017 |accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref> Previously Juventus won finals in [[1985 European Cup Final|1985]] and [[1996 UEFA Champions League Final|1996]], and lost a record six in [[1973 European Cup Final|1973]], [[1983 European Cup Final|1983]], [[1997 UEFA Champions League Final|1997]], [[1998 UEFA Champions League Final|1998]], [[2003 UEFA Champions League Final|2003]] and [[2015 UEFA Champions League Final|2015]]. This was also their 14th final in all seasonal UEFA competitions, having also played in one [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] final (winning in [[1984 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1984]]) and four [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] finals (winning in [[1977 UEFA Cup Final|1977]], [[1990 UEFA Cup Final|1990]] and [[1993 UEFA Cup Final|1993]], and losing in [[1995 UEFA Cup Final|1995]]). If they were to lose, Juventus would tie [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]'s record of five consecutive finals lost.

Title holders [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] reached a record 15th final after a 4–2 aggregate win against [[Madrid Derby|city rivals]] [[Atlético Madrid]], knocking them out of the competition for the fourth consecutive season.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Scott|title=Atlético Madrid 2-1 Real Madrid (agg 2-4): Champions League semi-final – as it happened|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/may/10/atletico-madrid-v-real-madrid-champions-league-semi-final-live|website=The Guardian|accessdate=10 May 2017|date=10 May 2017}}</ref> Real Madrid went into the final as top scorers of the 2016–17 Champions League, having scored 32 goals.

===Summary===
[[File:Cristiano Ronaldo entrenando (crop) (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Cristiano Ronaldo]], who scored twice, was named [[Man of the Match]].]]
Juventus dominated possession in the opening 19 minutes of the match, and had three major chances to score. [[Gonzalo Higuaín]] had two shots on goal that were easily saved by [[Keylor Navas]], while [[Miralem Pjanić]] had a more dangerous chance that Navas dived to push wide to his right. Despite the scoring chances, as well as the closing down of Real Madrid's counterattacks in the midfield, [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] scored the first goal of the match in the 20th minute; [[Dani Carvajal]] played a one-two on the right with Ronaldo before passing across for him to shoot low to the left corner of the net, which deflected in off the right foot of [[Leonardo Bonucci]].<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite news |last1=Das |first1=Andrew |last2=Smith |first2=Rory |date=3 June 2017 |title=Real Madrid Beats Juventus for 2nd Straight Champions League Title |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/03/sports/champions-league-final-score.html?_r=0 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref><ref name="Guardian">{{cite news |date=3 June 2017 |title=Real Madrid and Cristiano Ronaldo see off Juventus to win Champions League |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/03/juventus-real-madrid-champions-league-final-match-report |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref> Juventus responded with a goal seven minutes later to bring the score to 1–1.

==Post-match==
With their win, Real Madrid secured a record-extending twelfth title in the European Cup/Champions League and became the first club to win back-to-back titles in the Champions League era.<ref>{{cite news |date=3 June 2017 |title=Real Madrid become first team to win back-to-back Champions League finals |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1716/champions-league/2017/06/03/36078802/real-madrid-become-first-team-to-win-back-to-back-champions |work=Goal.com |accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref> This was the club's third title win in four seasons; a feat that has only occurred thrice before – Real Madrid (1956–60), Ajax (1971–73) and Bayern Munich (1974–76).

===Reactions===
At the post-match press conference, Allegri stated that Juventus had played well in the first-half but failed to make the most of their chances. He felt that his team "let go psychologically" after conceding the second goal. Allegri added, "Even if Real Madrid had a very good second half and have excellent players who can change the game at any moment, that second goal knocked the wind out of our sails. They raised the tempo, as we were the ones pushing Real Madrid back in the first half, but in the second we couldn't play our way out of defence and they kept pushing us back. At that moment, we should've taken out the extra energy to push hard and keep the game open, as we know Real Madrid leave you the chances to score at all times, but we conceded the third goal and that was really damaging."<ref>{{cite web|title=Juventus 'let go psychologically' in Champions League final - Max Allegri|url=http://www.espnfc.com/juventus/story/3138465/max-allegri-juventus-let-go-psychologically-in-champions-league-final|website=ESPNFC.com|accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref> Juventus captain Buffon stated that losing the match was a big disappointment. He felt his side had "an excellent first half, where we caused Real Madrid huge problems" but "in the second half their class, strength and how accustomed they are to winning these games showed through. They won deservedly." If Juventus had won, Buffon would have become the oldest player to win a Champions League surpassing compatriot [[Paolo Maldini]]. FIFA President [[Gianni Infantino]], who attended the match, told reporters, "Juventus played a great first half, then in the second Real Madrid were extraordinary. They were two excellent sides and in the end the best team won."<ref>{{cite web|title=Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon: It all went wrong for us vs. Real|url=http://www.espnfc.com/juventus/story/3138414/juventus-goalkeeper-gianluigi-buffon-it-all-went-wrong-for-us-vs-real-madrid|website=ESPNFC.com|accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref>

Zidane declared that his players deserved to win the double and become the first team to defend the title in the Champions league era. Zidane stated, "They have made history, for sure. Nobody has done it, and now we have. Today is a historic day for all Madridistas, for the players, for me, for all our family. But saying this, you know how it is. Next year will be much more difficult. We will have to work a lot to try and win again. But today we can say we are a very good team, and we deserved to win La Liga and the Champions League. It was not easy." He also felt that "a lot of hard work" was the reason behind the team's success. Zidane also revealed that he had instructed his players to "keep going, but to play a bit higher up the pitch, and to keep the ball" during the half-time team talk.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zinedine Zidane hails historic Real Madrid win, vows to stay at Bernabeu|url=http://www.espnfc.com/real-madrid/story/3138462/zinedine-zidane-hails-historic-real-madrid-win-and-vows-to-stay-at-club-for-next-season|website=ESPNFC.com|accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref>

Ramos said he was proud that Madrid had "kept their date with history" and felt it was because of the harmonious relationship among the players. Madrid's captain said, "We are tremendously proud of this team, and this institution. We had a date with history and were really looking forward to it. For 59 years we had not achieved the double, and nobody had ever won two Champions Leagues in a row. We were able to keep a dressing room without any jealousies and that was key. Success does not come by coincidence. We are a great group, headed by a great coach in Zidane. Three Champions Leagues in four years is crazy." Kroos revealed that he did not believe that Madrid would be able to successfully defend the trophy saying, "I didn't expect it would be possible to defend this title as it's so difficult to win it once. But to do it twice in a row is unbelievable. To win it three times in the last four years means a lot. It means it's not only a good team on the pitch but off the pitch. It's like that and I'm happy to be part of the team." Kroos also pointed out that Juventus had only conceded three goals in their entire Champions League campaign, and that scoring four against them in the final was a sign of Madrid's quality.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gareth Bale: Real Madrid's Champions League triumph an 'incredible scene'|url=http://www.espnfc.com/real-madrid/story/3138394/gareth-bale-real-madrids-champions-league-triumph-incredible|website=ESPNFC.com|accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref>

Modrić said that Madrid's performance in the first half was because they had "dropped back too much". He felt that the team's performance improved in the second half after Zidane instructed them to become "more aggressive" and "to not allow Juve to keep the ball easily".<ref>{{cite web|title=Luka Modric: This Real Madrid side can win more Champions Leagues|url=http://www.espnfc.com/real-madrid/story/3138673/luka-modric-this-real-madrid-side-can-win-more-champions-leagues|website=ESPNFC.com|accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref> Cardiff native Bale stated that winning the title in his hometown was a "great feeling".
