==Background==
Defending champions [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] reached a record 16th final after a 4–3 aggregate win against [[Bundesliga|German]] side [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], knocking them out of the competition for the second consecutive season. This was Real Madrid's third consecutive final, and fourth final in five tournaments with an opportunity to win a [[European Cup and UEFA Champions League records and statistics|record 13th title]]. Previously they won finals in [[1956 European Cup Final|1956]], [[1957 European Cup Final|1957]], [[1958 European Cup Final|1958]], [[1959 European Cup Final|1959]], [[1960 European Cup Final|1960]], [[1966 European Cup Final|1966]], [[1998 UEFA Champions League Final|1998]], [[2000 UEFA Champions League Final|2000]], [[2002 UEFA Champions League Final|2002]], [[2014 UEFA Champions League Final|2014]], [[2016 UEFA Champions League Final|2016]] and [[2017 UEFA Champions League Final|2017]]; and lost in [[1962 European Cup Final|1962]], [[1964 European Cup Final|1964]] and [[1981 European Cup Final|1981]]. This was also their 20th final in all seasonal UEFA competitions, having also played in two [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] finals (losing in [[1971 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1971]] and [[1983 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1983]]) and two [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] finals (winning in [[1985 UEFA Cup Final|1985]] and [[1986 UEFA Cup Final|1986]]).

Milan|Milan]] in [[1995 UEFA Champions League Final|1995]] and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in [[1998 UEFA Champions League Final|1998]]. They are the first team in the Champions League era, and the fourth overall, to win three straight finals, a feat only achieved by the Real Madrid side of the 1950s, as they went on to win a record five successive finals, as well as the [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] squads of the 1970s in [[1973 European Cup Final|1973]] and [[1976 European Cup Final|1976]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web|last=Saffer|first=Paul|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2554889.html|title=Three in a row: Real Madrid making final history|website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=1 May 2018}}</ref>
